The following actions are required for any service setup

1. Install the service packages with yum or rpm

    yum install service_package_name

2. Configure the service to start on boot:
    
    systemctl enable service_name

3. Modify the service configuration files in /etc
    This task will be unique for each service, and will
    require the most amount of time

4. Configure the SElinux variables. If you won't use SELinux you need
to disable it permanently with the following commands:

    setenforce permissive
    sed -i -e 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/sysconfig/selinux

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    a. If you are leaving SElinux enabled, you need to configure the SELinux booleans
        You can view the available boolean types for services in the directory:

            /sys/fs/selinux/booleans

        Grepping for the service name will normally filter out booleans for the specific
        service:

            ls -l /sys/fs/selinux/booleans | grep service_name
        
        Permenately set an Selinux boolean:

             setsebool -P selinux_boolean

    b. Configure the SElinux file contexts for the service
        The safest way to configure file contexts is with the commands
        'semanage fcontext' and 'restorecon'. chcon will not survive a filesystem
        relabeling if a context differs from the default vlaue
        defined in the SELinux policy
        
        The SElinux contexts are stored in the direcotry:
            
             /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files

        Configure file contexts:

             semanage fcontext -a -t selinux_context-type "/path/(/.*)?"
             restorecon -R -v /path



5. Start the service:

    systemctl start service_name

6. Confirm the necessary ports are open on the host based firewall. You must
also ensure the network firewall is configured properly as well.

    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
    firewall-cmd --reload

    OR

    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
    firewall-cmd --reload

    OR

    IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT (temporary)
    Configure /etc/sysconfig/iptables for permanent config

7. Test server functionality both locally and remotely
