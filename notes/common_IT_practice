All references to documentation can, and should be centralized in a single version controlled
system (git)

1. Firewall specific diagram that lists all allowed traffic on the network
2. Visio diagram of server architecture
3. Imaging scripts (kickstart) must be stored in a single directory and documented
4. ALL SCRIPTS USED ON SERVERS must be stored in an organized directory and documented
5. Central location of isos must exist and be documented
6. Ensure each server as a unique interface for at least management, and service (can further expand this for a log network, and whatever you want)

Configs that should be checked into GIT:
-------------------------------------------
Alternatives
/etc/alternatives

Apache
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Kick start scripts (imaging)
