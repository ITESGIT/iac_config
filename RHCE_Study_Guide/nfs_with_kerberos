# 1. Install packages
    yum -y install nfs-utils

# 2. Enable firewall
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
    firewall-cmd --reload

# 3. Configure SeLinux
# The booleans nfs_export_all_ro and nfs_export_allrw
# are turned on by default. no configuration is required
#
# 4. Enable and Start services

    systemctl enable nfs-server
    systemctl start nfs-server
 
 # 5. Configure nfs server for kerberos
 
    systemctl enable nfs-secure-server
    systemctl start nfs-secure-server

 # 6. The client must configure to use secure kerberos as well
    systemctl enable nfs-secure
    systemctl start nfs-secure

 # 7. Download required packages for client to authenticate with kerberos
 
    yum -y install krb5-workstation pam_krb5

 # 8. use the kadmin tool on the remote client to add principals to the keytab
 #  on both the client and server. Or if the ports aren't opened on the kerberos host, you must
 #  run kadmin.local on the kerberos server, and scp the generated keytabs to the other hosts
 #
 #  On the client you must add the host keytab for the client server, and add the host, AND snfs service principal
 #  for the nfs server.
