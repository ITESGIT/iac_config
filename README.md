# iac_config
Repository to contain my private server configurations, and provisioning scripts.

This repository will currently contain kickstart files for various servers, and 
virt-install scripts. The goal as I get better is to have every aspect of my private network
to be recreated through a template. The structure of the directories will be reorganzied
as I continue building.
