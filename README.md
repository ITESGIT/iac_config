# iac_config

This repository will contain organized scripts and configuration files that will allow
me to provision, and manage servers effectively.

The repository contains hard coded configurations, and scripts that could be uesd to
recreate my network. As I increase my skills with python (now perl...) and config management tools, I hope to replace these files with more flexible, dynamic scripts.

If you are reading this, I don't recommend on using much, this place is very much a playground
that has gotten disorganized.

The files within kickstarts/ and configuration_files/dns can be used as good references to look at a working
configuration, but thats about it for now.
