# iac_config

I have changed the purpose of this repository several times as I have advanced my skills with
Linux, and various tools. I began by creating inflexible kickstart scripts, bash scripts, 
and config files. 

After discovering how powerful configuration management tools are, I became amazed at how 
unproductive I (and most people) are at system administration. 
Configuring a server is easy... Like really easy. 
Configuring 100+ functional servers, that all work together? Not as easy.

Fortunately, Puppet is here to save the day. I will leave my previous files intact, 
but this repository will mainly be for my Puppet modules (and ruby assuming I stick with it). 
My Puppet development is done on my own Git server, that is automatically pushed to my Puppet server. 
That kind of defeats the purpose of this repository, as I am now developing locally. 

I'm still debating if I want to reconfigure my workflow, and move my Puppet development to this repository, but it isn't close to a priority at this time.


NOTE - While I don't have any passwords in any files, I do have site data scattered across all my files.I don't really care if people know my home configuration, as it is all a playground. Besides, The goal is to get to the point where I can rebuild my environment with a couple scripts if need be (PowerCLI mass VM deploy / Provision Tool ? / Puppet)
