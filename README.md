# iac_config

This repository will contain organized scripts and configuration files that will allow
me to provision, and manage servers effectively.

The repository contains hard coded configurations, and scripts that could be uesd to
recreate my network. As I increase my skills with python and config management tools, I hope to replace these files with more flexible, dynamic scripts.
